### Speaking

I've spoken at numerous conferences throughout my career, and I do enjoy public speaking, however due to the nature
of the pandemic, combined with the changing of my role, I haven't been able to present as often as I would have liked.

That being said, here's a small selection of the talks that I've given over the past decade:

* PyTorch Conference 2022: Using PyTorch Mobile - [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THSt5sCYzRs) [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/infil00p/Pytorch_MobileNet_Stats)
* Tensorflow World 2019: Using TFLite on Android using C++ - [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/infil00p/tf_world)
* OSCON 2019: From Inner Source to Open Source - [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/infil00p/inner-source)
* PhoneGap Day EU 2017 - [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMHsZIFWSwQ&list=PLqoBTl91Z2GGoDD1r7gR-UsbZuRlCtXT9&index=13) [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/infil00p/WebVR_Presentation_AFrame_ReactVR)
