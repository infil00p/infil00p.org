## Back to Static

It's been quite a while, and things have definitely changed. I decided that I'm very out of practice with front-end 
web development so I'm going to switch to a next.js static blog.  The main purpose of the blog is to store longer form
writing with some nice photos from hiking adventures.

## Life update

After twelve years, I'm leaving Adobe and I'm hiking the Pacific Crest Trail.  Due to loose ends like sending my work
laptop back, paying property taxes, etc, I'm having to do a southbound thru-hike starting in Harts Pass, Washignton on 
June 17th, 2024, and I hope to finish the trail around November 20th.  The reasons for hiking the PCT are as follows:

* It's there
* I don't remember the last time I've been away from a keyboard for more than a week in the last thirty years
* I'd rather hike 20 miles a day than take Ozempic
* I'm not getting any younger
* It's getting weird hanging out at Thur-Hiker events and not being a real thru-hiker
* I want to be able to eat absolute garbage and not be fat
* I need to lose weight, because being a fat packrafter sucks

## What are you going to do for work?

Honestly, I have no idea right now. A big motivator for me right now is going on adventures, and the fact is that while
I was able to travel to the bay area a lot, and go to conferences, those weren't adventures.  There are only so many trails
in Pinnacles National Park before you've hiked them all.
