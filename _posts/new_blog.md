## Back to Static

It's been quite a while, and things have definitely changed. I decided that I'm very out of practice with front-end 
web development and I'm going to have to suck up my pride and really learn Typescript and React by working on a project, 
hence the migration to next.js, because as much as I don't like it, React won years ago.

There's also the fact that I wasn't maintaining my Wordpress blog, so that's a thing.

## What are you doing now?

Honestly, outside of work, which I currently can't discuss, I'm not working on new tech at the moment (because of my contract).  What I am doing is
setting up a blog for my adventures, whether they be hiking, bikepacking, packrafting, or simply car camping and doing roadtrips
in my Rivian R1T.  I was thinking of starting a vlog, but that requires a lot of work and I'd rather just write and take pictures
than constantly leave my cameras and GoPros everywhere getting shots of me walking away from them, only for me to have to go back 
and pick them up.

## Wait, is this a personal adventure blog?

Yes, it's a personal blog. The content on here is going to be about how I go on adventures, where I'm going, and maybe it'll have 
some good information for other people who also want to go on an EV Roadtrip, or hike a trail, or start packrafting.  I'm not an
expert at any of these things (except maybe the EV roadtrip thing), and I'll definitely defer to others who are, but if you want
to see maps, and other information written down, here's the place for it.
