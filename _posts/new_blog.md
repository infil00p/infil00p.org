### Hello, Again

I haven't maintained a blog in years, and in fact I don't think most people have.  I switched back to Wordpress
a few years ago, but that never stuck, and I feel the need to re-start the blog from the beginning, so here it is.

## Who I am

I'm Joe Bowser, I've done many things, but I'm most well known for being a Software Developer who co-created PhoneGap and Apache Cordova, a framework
for making Mobile Applications using HTML, CSS and Javascript.  I'm also known for the following things:

* Working on OnDevice Machine Learning Features and doing presentations at conferences
* Being spied on by the RCMP for five years due to the 2010 Olympics and me being against them
* Co-Founding a Campus-Based Community Radio Station in Prince George
* Co-Founding the Vancouver Hack Space and disavowing it once they decided to add cameras
* Doing a Community WiFi thing and deciding that it actually needs to come from the communities it serves
* Putting on a Live Hip-Hop concert in Surrey despite not knowing anything about HipHop or the Vancouver Hip Hop scene in the late 2000s, or even being from Vancouver
* Owning a Rivian R1T

And now I'm going to be starting on my next big adventure, which is hiking 2650 miles from Mexico to Canada on the Pacific Crest Trail.  I'm leaving my job
of seventeen years (some would argue the job left me), leaving my family for five whole months, leaving the whole GenAI hype and tech in general behind.

## WHY?

In short, I'm burned out and the job market sucks. I also need to get away from the hype machine that is AI to actually figure out if any of my startup ideas
are any good and can be used by real people or businesses. I've been at the forefront of software development on and off for seventeen years at this point, first with mobile, and more recently with AI.  I honestly need a break from tech.


## OK, But why the PCT?

 * The trail is there
 * I'm probably never going to be unemployed for a long time after this stint of unemployment.  The last time I was unemployed was 2007.
 * I need to lose weight, and I can't afford Ozempic
 * It looks better on LinkedIn than "I just sat around at home playing Baldurs Gate 3"

## OK, you're going to do the trail and then what?

I don't know yet.  I might do a startup? I might just get a new job? I might just sell my house give up on tech and the lower mainland and move somewhere cheaper and get a non-tech job that covers my expenses.  That's the cool thing about the future, it's unwritten.

## This is an absolutely terrible idea! What have you done?!!?!?!

There's two types of reactions when I tell people that I'm leaving my job and doing the trail:

* This is an absolutely terrible idea
* That's the coolest thing I ever heard

The reality is that people are generally risk-averse and while a situation might be awful, because they're in America, or because they don't have the money or the life experience, they think that
